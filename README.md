## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Javascript, a bit of it.
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was more about taking a challenge that will help me deepen my skills in terms of building responsive website page layouts using CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox. I got to understand more about making my grid layout responsive.

### Continued development

This feels like it was an easy challenge. I would like do more responsive layouts that can be applied to real projects. But as far as simple layout I feel I have the basics right. This was a good push for me to take some more challenges
